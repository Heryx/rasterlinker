GeoSurvey Studio is a QGIS plugin developed to streamline the management and visualization of grouped raster datasets, particularly suited for GPR and grid-based survey workflows.

Key Features:
- Recursive detection of layer groups and subgroups
- Multi-group selection support
- Dynamic raster visibility control using dial and slider widgets
- Automatic cycling of rasters within selected groups
- Zoom-to-selected-groups functionality
- Real-time display of the currently visible raster name
- Aggregated raster listing across multiple selected groups
- Clean layer-tree integration without modifying original data

The plugin enhances structured raster navigation within complex QGIS projects, 
especially where multiple raster slices or time/depth grids must be inspected sequentially.

GeoSurvey Studio is designed to support non-invasive survey workflows and structured spatial analysis environments.
